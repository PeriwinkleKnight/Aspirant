## Armour
Armour [Equipment](Equipment) is your character's safety net. It is designed to protect against only a small amount of high-powered attacks. However, advanced armour can be almost impervious to simpler weapons. Armour will protect certain locations on your body. A suit of armour together has shared integrity, but separate details for each location it protects on your body. Some armours will stack, such as shields and energy fields. If you have multiple valid armour sources, you can choose to use whichever you want (though only 1 per attack).

### Locations
Armour is separated into 4 distinct sections. Head, Torso, Arms, Legs.

### Materials
Armour is made of specific [materials](materials) which have 4 distinct attributes: Weakness, Resistance, Structure, Max Skill. To function as protection, a piece of armour must be made of at least Martial quality materials even if it is of a Basic design. Materials also influences which [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits) are available for Martial and Exotic armours.

#### Max Skill
affects different locations separately and is the maximum bonus you can have on related skill tests before negatives are applied. 

| Location | Skills effected                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Head     | [Perception](Perception), and [Converse](Converse)    |
| Arms     | [Melee](Melee), [Marksmanship](Marksmanship), and [Channel](Channel)|
| Torso    | *No Penalties*                                 |
| Legs     | [Acrobatics](Acrobatics), [Subterfuge](Subterfuge)                                               |

#### Weakness and Resistance
Changes how certain [types of damage](Combat#Types%20of%20Damage) effect you. If a piece of armour would gain a resistance or weakness complementary to an existing Resistance or Weakness on the armour through [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits), the two cancel out resulting in no effect. If a piece of armour would gain a resistance or weakness it already has through [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits), there is no effect. See [dealing damage](Combat#Dealing%20Damage) for details. 

#### Structure
Contributes to your overall armours integrity. Allowing it to take more hits before becoming non-functional.

#### Material Table

| Material  | Max Skill | Structure | Weakness | Resistance |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Textile   | 8         | 1         | Heat     | -          |
| Leather   | 7         | 2         | Life     | -          |
| Wood      | 6         | 3         | Heat     | -          |
| Metal     | 5         | 4         | Cold     | -          | 
| Machinery | 6         | 1         | Impact   | -          |

### Quality
Armour can come in a variety of qualities. Higher quality armours gain access to [Armour-Traits](Armour-Traits) as well as the ability to incorporate additional [materials](materials) into their design. When multiple materials are used, one is treated as the primary material and the other as the secondary material. The armour's base attributes (Weakness, Resistance, Structure, and Max Skill) are determined by the primary material, while the secondary material represents the increase in complexity and robustness of higher quality gear. If the secondary material used is of the same Quality and has a Structure equal to or higher than the primary material, increase the armour's Structure by 1. 

#### Basic
Basic armour is improvised, hastily constructed, or primitive in nature, but may save your life when no other options are available. 

*Basic armours utilize a single material and have 0 trait points*

#### Martial

Martial armour is expressly built for the hardships of battle. When compared to basic armour, martial armours are more complex and more meticulously constructed often with specific functions in mind.

*Martial armours ultilize 2 materials and have 1 trait points*

#### Exotic

Exotic armours incorporate additional complexity of both materials and design allowing for further specialization of enhanced functionality thanks to the use of rare and advanced materials and expert craftsmanship.

*Exotic armours utilize 2 materials, one of which must be exotic quality, and have 2 trait points*

### Masterwork

Masterworked armour is a martial or exotic armour of exceptional craftsmanship and design. A piece of masterwork armour gains 1 additional trait point over its martial or exotic counterpart and may take a single [Armour-Trait](Armour-Traits) it does not meet the material requirement for. Masterwork armours must incorporate a material of similiar quality to an exotic armour in their construction.

### Armour Integrity
Your overall suit of armour will have an armour integrity, which is how well it all comes together to protect you. In other words, your armour suit has a shared amount of health over all locations. To calculate your suit of armour's integrity, add the structure values of all your armour pieces together. All armour suits no matter the pieces have at least 2 points of integrity, and for every 10 total structure value you get an additional point of armour integrity. 

> For example, a character with 4 pieces of leather gives 8 structure, looking at the tens' digit (0) gives the minimum value for armour, an integrity of 2.

> A character with 1 pieces of leather (2 structure) and 3 pieces of plate mail (6 each) has 20 total structure, looking at the ten's digit (2), that's an overall armour integrity of 4.

### Style
Characters shouldn’t be punished for dressing their characters in a specific way that doesn’t describe perfect protection. The most obvious, however dated, example is a chain mail bikini. Though silly and perhaps not something players would be comfortable with, if it is in your game, it counts as fully functional armour with similar weaknesses to any other armour of similar material. Players and, in most cases, NPCs should not have their narrative armour exploited.  

This extends to hats and helmets as well. Many players love the idea of a hero with their hair flowing in the wind and a perfect smile as they rush into battle. This vision doesn’t need to conflict with having a protected head. Characters could have headbands, thinly framed helmets, or even a high coif / scarf. These give the impression of head armour without giving up the vision of a hero.
